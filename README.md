# 🧑‍🚀 Space Suit Health Monitoring System (Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Space Suit Health Monitoring System is a mini hardware project designed to monitor the health and safety parameters of an astronaut inside a space suit. It continuously measures vital data such as heart rate, body temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters.

This project demonstrates the use of embedded systems and IoT for real-time health monitoring during space missions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor astronaut health in real time
- Ensure safety inside the space suit
- Reduce health risks during space missions
- Demonstrate sensor-based monitoring using a microcontroller

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- ESP32 / ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Heartbeat (Pulse) Sensor
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11 / DHT22)
- Safety / Environmental Sensor Module
- Connecting wires
- PCB / Breadboard
- USB cable / Power supply

## 💻 Software Used
